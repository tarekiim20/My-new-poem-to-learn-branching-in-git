Chapter VI: Song Unsung

Beneath the stars, the desert sleeps deep,
Where silent shadows secrets keep.
Whispers fade, forgotten dreams,
As dust reclaims what sunlight gleams.

The bloom, once vibrant, now but dust,
A fragile memory, turned to rust.
No breeze carries tales untold,
Only silence wraps the sands, cold.
